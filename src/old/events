Fernblick Luxury Villa
Fernblick Luxury Villa
Contemporary design, built for comfort and rejuvenation, amongst the natural beauty of the island.

Fern Blick Definition:  a German word meaning distant view. And the views from this magnificent property look out not only over the Gulf of Thailand toward Ang Thong Marine Park, but also to the unspoiled mountain jungles of Koh Phangan.
